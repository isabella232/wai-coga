  ## Introduction

  This is a draft interactive version of the latest [Content Usable and Design Guide](https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable) W3C note.

  The contents on the left can be expanded and closed with the content on the right updating to follow the selected item. The top Level **Objectives** contain design **Patterns** which describe techniques for best practice.

  Note: You will need to use a modern browser to get the interactive features as this temporary draft code needs [ES6 JavaScript support](https://caniuse.com/#search=es6). Once we are happy with the design, a suitable feature will be added to the WAI website framework - see [this WAI Website issue](https://github.com/w3c/wai-website/issues/138).

  [See page details in plan](../plan#design-guide)

  ## Adaptations for the Web Version

  Some aspects of the structure and layout have been altered to work best as an interactive web resource. For example:

  - Add Overview section containing: Background, Personalisation & User Testing sections 
  - Move Objective User Testing sections and ensure Patterns and stories are clearly testable
  - Section numbers are not required
  - Some Objective and Pattern names [altered to be short](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18gkODnzy_8BzZAieJ_IOQX1dmjcf9MZsC7vC9glKQvI/edit?usp=sharing) and so avoid wrapping
  - Trimmed and rearranged Pattern content to better support designers' requirements (see User Story below) 
  - Add mentions of WCAG SCs and Supplemental information
  - Add User Story to each Pattern.
  - Add links to related Patterns and WCAG 3.2.2 SCs in Quick Ref (which includes Supplemental Guidance)

  **A Designer's requirements when using this resource are summarized in this User Story**

  <blockquote>"As a designer or developer I want to know what to implement with just enough background to set the context and explain why. If I need more info, for example to better understand the users or to check edge cases, I want links to the details."</blockquote>

  See the [tracking page on the wiki](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/wiki/Design_Guide#List_of_candidate_Patterns_for_Web_Version").
