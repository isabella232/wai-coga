  ## Introduction

  This is a draft interactive version of the latest working draft of the [Content Usable and Design Guide](https://w3c.github.io/coga/content-usable) W3C note.

  The contents on the left can be expanded and closed with the content on the right updating to follow the selected item. The top Level **Objectives** contain design **Patterns** which describe techniques for best practice.

  You will need to use a modern browser to get the interactive features as this temporary draft code needs [ES6 JavaScript support](https://caniuse.com/#search=es6). Once we are happy with the design, a suitable feature will be added to the WAI website framework - see [this WAI Website issue](https://github.com/w3c/wai-website/issues/138).

  [See page details in plan](../plan#design-guide)

  ## Adaptations for the Web Version

  Some aspects of the structure and layout have been altered to work best as an interactive web resource. For example:

  - Section numbers are not required
  - Objective and Pattern names are kept short to avoid wrapping

  Other editorial changes support the user story when visiting the web resource:

    <blockquote>"As a designer or developer I want to know what to implement with just enough background to set the context and explain why. If I need more info, for example to better understand the users or to check edge cases, I want links to the details."</blockquote>

  These changes are mostly trimming and relocating content plus a little reorganization of content.

  See the [tracking page on the wiki](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/wiki/Design_Guide#List_of_candidate_Patterns_for_Web_Version").
