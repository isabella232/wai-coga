  ## Introduction
  This is a draft interactive version of the latest working draft of the [Design Guide](https://raw.githack.com/w3c/coga/design-doc-transfer/design/index.html) W3C note.

  The contents on the left can be expanded and closed with the content on the right updating to follow the selected item. The top Level **Objectives** contain  design **Patterns** which describe techniques for best practice.

  You will need to use a modern browser to get the interactive features as this temporary code needs [ES6 JavaScript support](https://caniuse.com/#search=es6). Once we are happy with the design, a suitable feature will be added to the WAI website framework - see [this WAI Website issue](https://github.com/w3c/wai-website/issues/138).

  [See page details in plan](../plan#design-guide)

  ## Adaptations for the Web Version
  Some aspects of the structure and layout have been altered to work best as an interactive web resource. For example:

  - Section numbers are not required
  - Objective and Pattern names are kept short to avoid wrapping

  Other editorial changes support the user story when visiting the web resource:

  <blockquote>"As a designer or developer I want to know what to implement with just enough background to set the context and explain why. If I want more info, for example to check edge cases, I can use links to other resources like gap analysis, user requirements etc."</blockquote>

  For example:

  - ensure text is a succinct **what to do guide** for developers. Extract and link all content that supports this
  - adjust titles to be consistent voice - see [this suggestions document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18gkODnzy_8BzZAieJ_IOQX1dmjcf9MZsC7vC9glKQvI/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Patterns contain example user stories. The User Stories section in each Objective can be moved out to a new document and linked to.
  - Patterns make it clear how they can be tested. The User Testing section in each Objective can probably be removed and linked to.
  - Objective text should introduce the common features of the included Patterns in terms of 'what to do' with a little context as to why it is important.
  - Provide links to external detailed and supporting info like User Requirements
  - the 'Technical details' sections may need attention so linked content is in consistent state of maturity and publication status

  ## Priority Patterns for Easy Reading project use


  - Help users understand purpose and interactions  
    - Clearly identify controls and their use 
    - Use symbols that help the user 

  - Help users find what they need
    - Ensure most important things are easy to find 

  - Use clear and understandable content (select a couple of these)
    - Use clear words
    - Use a simple tense and written language
    - Do not use double negatives or clauses inside clauses
    - Use literal language
    - Keep text succinct 
    - Use white spacing
    - Use clear and accurate text formatting and punctuation 
    - Provide alternatives for numbers 

  - Help users avoid mistakes or correct them
    - Use clear labels and instructions 

  - Ensure processes do not rely on memory
    - Ensure log in does not require good memory or cognitive skills 

  - Provide help and support
    - Make it easy to find help and give feedback 

  - Support Adaptation and Personalization
    - Support Simplification
    - Support Personalization
