## User stories

- I can easily find the content or feature I am looking for;
- I can easily understand and navigate both the site structure and individual pages;
- I do not get lost in a complex information architecture when I want to find something;
- I can easily work out how to get to what I want when it requires navigation from where I am;
- I can see all important features without them being hidden off screen and requiring scrolling;
- I can easily search for anything I want or have searched for before.
- I can easily go back to correct or undo something I did unintentionally.
