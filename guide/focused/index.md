## Introduction

Distractions can cause users with cognitive disabilities problems such as:

- They can lose focus on the current action;
- draw attention away from the task they are trying to do; and
- can be difficult for some users to know how to understand, avoid, and/or stop them.

Once users become distracted, it can be difficult for them to remember what they were doing. Then they can no longer complete their task at all. This is especially problematic for users with both low attention and impaired memory, such as users with dementia.

Items like bread crumbs can help orientate the user and help the user restore the context when it is lost. Note, Making breadcrumbs clickable can also help the user undo mistakes.
