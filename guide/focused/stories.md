## User stories

- As a user who is easily distracted I need less distractions from my task;
- I prefer only the content related to the task in hand to be on display so I do not get distracted.
- As a user with a poor memory I need easy sign posts such as headers or breadcrumbs to remind me what is on the screen, where I am in a process and what I am doing.
