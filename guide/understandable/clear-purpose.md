Use a clear title or heading that summarizes the purpose of a page, or other clear signposts that have been tested by users with cognitive disabilities.

## How it helps

This helps many people, including those with poor memory, attention, or anyone who is easily distracted. This includes people with age-appropriate forgetfulness, or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD).

For example, someone with mild dementia is using online shopping. They get distracted and then when they look at the screen again they have forgotten what they were doing. Put a clear heading at the top of each page that shows clearly what the page is about and what they are doing.
