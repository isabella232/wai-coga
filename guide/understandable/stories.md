  Changes from doc: expanded and reworked - included testing stories

  We could add Testing Notes but I think uneccessary as the User Stories should make useful tests clear

## User stories

- I am familiar with the user interface elements such as menus, buttons and design components;
- I find the design familiar and elements common to many websites are where I expect them to be;
- I can figure out what this website offers and how to do what I want to do, or if I should move on;
- I can readily find the content or activity that I want as the architecture is understandable;
- I always recognize where I am in the architecture of the website, application or multi-step process;
- I can clearly identify which elements I can interact with and am confident about what will happen when I do;
- The language used is at my reading level and any symbols used are familiar to me. _TODO:move this to Clear Content_
