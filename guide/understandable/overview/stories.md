## User stories

This leads to the following user stories:

- I am familiar with the user interface (such as menus, buttons and design components) where everything happens, and I know how to work it and what will happen when I work it.
- I know what to click to make things happen
- I like content delivered in an easy-to-understand mode.
- I like simple content with few options and consistent text.
- I know what this page does
- I know how to do each task
