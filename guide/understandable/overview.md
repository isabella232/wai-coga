## Introduction

To be able to use a site or application, people need to know what all controls and elements are on your page and how to use them.

Not everyone finds learning new things easy, and not everyone can remember new designs.

The more people need to figure things out, the less people can use your site.

Many users cannot easily learn new design metaphors, or remember things they learned, such as users with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Without these skills, it can be much harder or impossible to find what they need, work out what the items do and how to use them.

Many users can be overwhelmed by too many options, or too much information. If reading is slow, then too much information mixed together will make it difficult or impossible to use the site.

Using familiar design, familiar terms and familiar symbols are key to being able to use the web for users who will struggle to remember new symbols and design. Users need the following to be familiar:

- Where to find elements: For example, people may look for the search on the top right hand corner of a page. If it - is somewhere else it will be hard to find.
- Symbols: For example, people may look for a question mark for help. If you use a different symbol less people - will know what it is.
- Text: Use text people know, including people with a limited vocabulary.
- How to get help: Always make it easy to find the help.

The use of personalization can be extremely useful in offering both familiarity as well as other benefits for users with cognitive and learning disabilities. This is important as what is familiar for one user may not be familiar to another. Familiarity is often based on the needs of the individual user.

## User testing

Make sure your user testing has all the different cognitive disabilities represented. (Make sure people don't just ask these as questions, but ask something that demonstrates it.)

Test for the following:

- Does the user know what the page is about (frame to make sure people don't just ask these as questions, but ask something that demonstrates it.)
- Does the user know what actions they can take on a page
- Does the user know where they are in a website, an application or a multistep process
- Can the user easily find the different sections of content
- Identify the different activities that the user may want to complete on the page.
  - Can they achieve the activities without asking for help
  - Does the user make errors trying to achieve the activities
  - Does they user find them easy to achieve

## User stories

This leads to the following user stories:

- I am familiar with the user interface (such as menus, buttons and design components) where everything happens, and I know how to work it and what will happen when I work it.
- I know what to click to make things happen
- I like content delivered in an easy-to-understand mode.
- I like simple content with few options and consistent text.
- I know what this page does
- I know how to do each task
