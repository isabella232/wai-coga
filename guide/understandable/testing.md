## User testing

Make sure your user testing has all the different cognitive disabilities represented. (Make sure people don't just ask these as questions, but ask something that demonstrates it.)

Test for the following:

- Does the user know what the page is about (frame to make sure people don't just ask these as questions, but ask something that demonstrates it.)
- Does the user know what actions they can take on a page
- Does the user know where they are in a website, an application or a multistep process
- Can the user easily find the different sections of content
- Identify the different activities that the user may want to complete on the page.
  - Can they achieve the activities without asking for help
  - Does the user make errors trying to achieve the activities
  - Does they user find them easy to achieve
