## Description

Provide additional explanatory content for information that is complex.

## User Story

<blockquote class="pull">I can understand complex content as contextually-relevant graphs, pictures and tables are provided to supplement it</blockquote>

## What To Do

Provide additional help content that explains any complex information. It may be provided in various forms, for example:

- Text "asides" providing explanation and help
- A supporting chart or graph to illuminate text content
- A supplemental table â€“ as long as it is not itself complex
- Popup on hover explanations of keywords - possibly linked to a glossary

## How It Helps

This Pattern builds on help related WCAG Success Criteria to ensure users are effectively supported in understanding complex content.

Users should be able understand the content they find and successfully complete described tasks without requiring further external assistance. If content is sufficiently complex then it may be inaccessible without the provision of additional supporting help.

## More details

The complexity is often inherent in the information itself, for example the language used, the quantity of information, or the subject matter. In this case, it is likely to need very careful explanation, organisation and presentation for all users to be able to understand without any mistakes, confusion or need of assistance.

The provision of supporting content aids understanding.

## Examples, Techniques and Requirements

Success Examples:

- The explanation of a medical procedure is supported though the use of an additional text aside and diagrams.

Failure Examples:

- A detailed user guide for fitness device provides no extra explanations and only basic diagrams.
