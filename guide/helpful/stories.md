## User stories

- I want to be able to give feedback easily;
- I can easily identify the different ways I can Report Issues and Problems;
- I want to be able to give feedback as soon as I get stuck from any part in the process;
- I want to be able to give feedback in any form that other people can;
- I can request help and provide feedback at any stage of the process where I might get stuck;
- I can easily submit feedback without making errors or providing a lot of information;
- When I request help or give feedback it is clear to me what will happen next and how I will be contacted.
