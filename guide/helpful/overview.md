## Introduction

Users with cognitive impairments may need different levels and forms of help, depending on their circumstances. Note that a lot can be achieved through supporting personalization.

## User Testing

Make sure your user testing has all the different cognitive disabilities represented. (Make sure people don't just ask these as questions, but ask something that demonstrates it.)

Test for the following :

- Identify the different activities
  - Test that the users can achieve the activities without asking for help
  - Does the user make errors trying to achieve the activities
  - Does the user find them easy to achieve
  - Ask the users if they would find this easy to do if under stress or tiered
  - Ask the user what might help if they were stressed or tired. If they do not have ideas ask them about the design guidance bellow and if any of them would help them for this content. Ask them for other idea
- Can the user find help?

  - Does the user make errors trying to find help?
  - Does the user find them easy to achieve?
