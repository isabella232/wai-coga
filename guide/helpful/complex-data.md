## Description

Provide outlines of key themes shown in complex data and graphs.

## User Story

<blockquote class="pull">I can understand complex tables or graphs as extra help is provided to explain the important features</blockquote>

## What To Do

Provide additional help content that explains any complex data tables and graphs and guides interpretation. It may be provided in various forms, for example:

- Text "asides" providing explanation and help
- Popup on hover explanations of key data points

## How It Helps

This Pattern builds on help related WCAG Success Criteria to ensure users are supported in understanding complex content. Explaining the presentation of complex data makes it understandable in the content of the content.

## More details

The presentation mode of information such as a graph or table may obscure its meaning through complexity. A supporting description and guided interpretation will highlight the the key features the user needs to understand.

## Examples, Techniques and Requirements

Success Examples:

- The key points of a table and graph of voting statistics content are explained so it is clear how they are relevant to the other content.

Failure Examples:

- A graph and data table of sales figures is shown without any explanation of the key features that relate to the content.

WCAG Techniques and Success Criteria:

- [3.3.5 Help](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#help)
