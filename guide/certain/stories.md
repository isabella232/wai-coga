## User stories

- As a user who needs to look up my postal/zip code, I do not want a session to time out while I try to find the information needed;
- As a user who needs to take breaks during tasks, such as completing a form, I want to be sure all my work is saved automatically if my computer crashes. I do not want to have to start over again, which can create a cycle of reentering my data; and making me more tired and more likely to make mistakes;
- As a user with difficulty typing numbers in the right order, I want an interface that makes mistakes less likely;
- As a user who finds entering information stressful, I want to enter as little information as I can so the task is more manageable.
