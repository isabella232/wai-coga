## Description

Provide clear labels, explanations and clarifications that help users avoid making mistakes

## User Story

<blockquote class="pull">As someone who has anxiety I understand what I need to enter and so avoid error messages that upset me.</blockquote>

## What To Do

Provide clear instructions at the start of the process. Use labels that clearly identify required content. Any restrictions on allowed user input should be made clear at the point of input and not presented as an error message when the user eventually submits something.

## How it helps

Clear instructions help prevent user making mistakes and so being presented with error messages. This avoids breaking the users interaction flow and so reduces frustration or the need to seek help. This helps anybody with memory issues, people from a different culture, and people on autism spectrum who may miss cultural context.

## More details

## Examples

### Sufficient

- An accessible image of a passport indicates where the required number can be be found.

### Insufficient

- A calendar control does not not indicate the day considered to be the start of the week (e.g., Sunday or Monday).
