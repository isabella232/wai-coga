## Description

Provide alternatives for numbers and numerical concepts

## User Story

<blockquote class="pull">As someone with dyscalculia I can better understand the content as it minimizes the use of numbers and maths or provides alternatives.</blockquote>

## What To Do

Avoid use of numbers when they are not critical and provide replacements. For example:

- Use familiar value names names rather than numbers
- Avoid requiring mental calculations - even if they appear to be trivial
- Be consistent with units

## How It Helps

Not all people can easily understand numbers and numerical concepts. In particular, people with dyscalculia have significant problems with numbers and mathematical concepts but otherwise have little difficulty with content.

When data is presented only in numerical format it can be much harder for some to understand than when non-numeric values are provided (cold, warm, hot etc.).

Even relatively common mental calculations such decimal unit conversions can be very hard for some people and may infact distract everyone from understanding content. For example, the need to calculate that 0.9m is the same as 900mm should be avoided by always using tha same unit.

## More details

???It should be noted that different users may find math easier to understand than long text.

Provide reading support where some math skills are essential for the content. For example,

- Prefer digital math that can be programmatically manipulated (not numbers in images)
- Break numerical content up and enable highlighting of sections
- Link sections of numbers to extra help
- Enable replacing math sections with words or summaries for users who prefer this.

Content that may need extra support include understanding what the representation of a number may mean as a concept of:

    size
    quantity
    distance
    time
    date
    temperature
    positive/negative
    calculation
    sequencing
    memory
    cultural differences
    alternative representation

## Examples

### Sufficient

A weather chart uses non-numerical values suc has "Cold", "Mild" and "Hot" as well as numbers.

### Insufficient

A train schedule has a long list of times relative to the hour rather than actual timess.
