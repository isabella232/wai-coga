Use the tense and the voice is easiest to understand. In English this is usually the present tense and active voice. Speak directly to the user, and use the simplest form of verbs.

## How It Helps

This benefits many people, including those with language impairments, learning disabilities or a poor memory.

Present tense makes it clear that an action is being, or should be, performed.

Active voice makes it clear who is supposed to do what.

## More details

- Other voices or tenses can be used if they have been shown to be easier to understand or friendlier.
- In languages where present tense and active voice do not exist, or are not clearer, use the tense and the voice that are easiest to understand.
- If you are writing about past or future events, do not use the present tense as that will be confusing.

## Examples

### Insufficient
