## Description

Use words that are common and clear.

## User Story

<blockquote class="pull">I understand all the words used and am not confused by any that I do not know.</blockquote>

## What To Do

- Use at the most common words and phrases. These are the terms that people with lower language skills are most likely to know
- Do not invent new words or give words new meanings that must be learned for the content
- If you must use new terms, jargon, abbreviations, mnemonics or acronyms then make sure they are accompanied by an explanation
*? should these be twisties (then needed for all bullets) or do we not go to this level ?*
  - Add an simple language term in brackets next to it
  - Consider a pop up definition
  - Provide a glossary

## How It Helps

Using unclear words presents a significant barrier to many people. This can easily be avoided by careful choice of words and the provision of explanations. For example, those with language impairments, learning disabilities or poor memory will be able to understand and use content. Also, explanations of any specialist words will help the majority of readers who do not share a domain expertise with the author. For example banking terms. Clear words are important given the average reading age is likely to much lower than commonly anticipated, eg is below 11 in the UK. They also help the many readers who do not share the same primary language as that used for the content.

## More details

This pattern helps ensure there are minimal barriers to those who require clear words. It also benefits all readers by reducing confusing or unknown words.
In addition to this pattern, WCAG section 3.1 addresses several related aspects of content readability (see below).

## Examples

### Sufficient

Use of clear words with definition of terms:

- Your landlord can only use your **security deposit (promise money)**, for certain things, such as **unpaid rent (rent that you owe)** and to fix things that you damaged.
- Your landlord must return your **security deposit (promise money)** to you by a clear date. This is usually 30 days after you leave the apartment.

### Insufficient

Unclear words (as well as other Pattern failures):

- A Landlord's Right to **Deduct**. When a **tenant** moves into a rental property, he or she will pay the landlord a **security deposit**. Depending on the **jurisdiction**, this deposit will be returned to the tenant within a **specific time** period at the **cessation** of the **lease term**, as long as the tenant follows all the terms and **tenants** of the **lease agreement** or contract. Select links below to read the laws that **pertain to your situation**.
