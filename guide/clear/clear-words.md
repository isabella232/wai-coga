## Description

Use common and clear words.

## User Story

I understand all the words used and am not confused by any that I do not know

## What To Do

- Look at the most common 1500 words or phrases. These are the terms that people with language impairments are most likely to know.
- Do not invent new words or give words new meanings that must be learned for the content.
- If you must use new terms or jargon make sure the user has easy access to an explanation.
- Avoid unnecessary words

## How It Helps

This pattern refines the WCAG techniques that address the readability of content. For example, it states text should avoid unclear words, rather than providing an alternative. It benefits many people including those with language impairments, learning disabilities or poor memory.
The the average reading age (in the UK) is below 11.

## More details

When using jargon, mnemonics or acronyms:

- Add an simple language term in brackets next to it
- Consider a pop up definition
- In supported mark up (see easylang) ???

## Examples, Techniques and Requirements

Success Examples:

Use of clear words with definition of terms:

- Your landlord can only use your **security deposit (promise money)**, for certain things, such as **unpaid rent (rent that you owe)** and to fix things that you damaged.
- Your landlord must return your **security deposit (promise money)** to you by a clear date. This is usually 30 days after you leave the apartment.

Failure Examples:

Unclear words (as well as other pattern failures):

- A Landlord's Right to **Deduct**. When a **tenant** moves into a rental property, he or she will pay the landlord a **security deposit**. Depending on the **jurisdiction**, this deposit will be returned to the tenant within a **specific time** period at the **cessation** of the **lease term**, as long as the tenant follows all the terms and **tenants** of the **lease agreement** or contract. Select links below to read the laws that **pertain to your situation**.

Use of an uncommon word:

- Someone with mild dementia is trying to turn on an ICT heating and air conditioning unit. The menu item for selecting heat or air conditioning is labelled **"mode"**. The user cannot use the unit because of this one term. This has caused emergencies such as hypothermia.
