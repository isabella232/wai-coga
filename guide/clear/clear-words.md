## Description

Use words that are common and clear to as many people as possible.

## User Story

<blockquote class="pull">I understand all the words used and am not confused or distracted by any words or abbreviations that I do not know.</blockquote>

## What To Do

Use the most common words and phrases that people with lower reading level or language skills are most likely to know. In particular:

- Pay particular attention to: headings, labels, navigational elements, instructions, and error messages;
- Take care with unusual words, abbreviations and reading level;
- Provide an explanation for any unusual words, jargon, abbreviations, mnemonics or acronyms. Consider the following techniques:
  - Add explanation in brackets next to it
  - Provide a pop up definition
  - Provide a glossary

_TODO: Consider making the above nested list a &lt;details&gt; or other expando._

## How It Helps

Using unclear or unknown words presents a significant barrier to many people. This can be avoided by careful choice of words and the provision of explanations.

For example, people with language impairments, learning disabilities, and poor memory will better understand the content when clear words are used. Also, your audience might not share domain expertise and benefit from explanations of specialist or technical words. Clear words are also important for people with lower language skills. For example, the average reading age in the UK is below 11. Clear words also help readers who do not share the same primary native language as that used for content.

## More details

The WCAG Guidelines under [3.1 Readable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#readable) addresses several related aspects of content readability and provide useful guidance.

## Examples

### Sufficient

Use of clear words with definition of terms:

- Your landlord can only use your **security deposit (promise money)**, for certain things, such as **unpaid rent (rent that you owe)** and to fix things that you damaged.
- Your landlord must return your **security deposit (promise money)** to you by a clear date. This is usually 30 days after you leave the apartment.

### Insufficient

Unclear and technical words (as well as other Pattern failures):

- A Landlord's Right to **Deduct**. When a **tenant** moves into a rental property, he or she will pay the landlord a **security deposit**. Depending on the **jurisdiction**, this deposit will be returned to the tenant within a **specific time** period at the **cessation** of the **lease term**, as long as the tenant follows all the terms and **tenants** of the **lease agreement** or contract. Select links below to read the laws that **pertain to your situation**.
