## Introduction

Users with memory issues or language issues can have difficulty remembering words or numbers. This may be especially difficult when they feel under any pressure such as the need to be quick to avoid a timeout.

That can make remembering passwords or activities such selecting letters from a password difficult or impossible. As a result the need to remember something can block users with cognitive disabilities when logging in to access a secure part or all of a website.
