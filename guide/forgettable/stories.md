## User stories

- As a user who has memory impairments and often forgets passwords, I need to be able to use a site, without remembering or transcribing passwords and user names, so I can use its service.
- As a user who has impairments, I need to use a site without being required to transcribe items in the correct sequence.
- As a user who has weak executive function, I need the login process to be simple, and not multi-step, so I can use it.
